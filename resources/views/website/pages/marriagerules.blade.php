  <h1 style="background-color:white">Marriage Rules</h1>
<p style="background-color:#800080; color:white"">
1)Marriages in Bangladesh are predominantly arranged, with relatively fewer choice (also referred to as “love”) marriages. <br>
2)Most men marry before the age of 35, while the majority of women marry before the age of 25.  While the past has shown that the average age for women getting married in rural areas is significantly lower (16 years of age) than that of those getting married in urban areas, even this age has recently increased significantly (to 20 years of age.<br> 
3)The increase in the average age of women getting married reflects an increasing preference among men (and the families that are arranging marriages for them) for potential spouses with greater educational qualifications. <br> 
4)These trends seem to be indicative of a preference for women who will be able to fulfill more traditional roles while simultaneously maintaining a job and contributing to the earned income of the family.</p>
